# How to Install R

## Simplest Way

[CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/)  

Choose one of the links you like, then you can see the `Download and Install R` section.  
I guess I will not have to go through the rest of the steps.

*Note: Remember to include the `.../bin` into the `%PATH%` if there is an option.*

## Package Managers

The name of the package is simply `r`. You can find it using `apt` `brew` `dnf` `pacman` etc.

## Then?

Install a code editor. Please don't use Notepad++ for coding.
